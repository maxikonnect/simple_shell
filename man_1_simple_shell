.TH HSH 1
.SH NAME
hsh \- Holberton Shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[command] [options ...]
.SH COPYRIGHT
hsh \- This is a project from the first trimester of Holberton School.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a shell command interpreter that executes commands read from standard input or a file.
.B hsh
is intended to be a clone of the standard command interpreter of
.B Unix
and
.B Unix-like
systems.
.SH OPTIONS
A simple command consists of optional variable assignments followed by space-separated words and redirections, terminated by a control operator. The first word specifies the command to be executed and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.
.PP
The exit status of a simple command is its return value, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.
.SS Pipelines
A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the control operators | or |&. The pipeline format is as follows:
.PP
[command [..ARGS]] [| - |&] [command2 [..ARGS]]
.PP
The standard output of the first command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of the second command. This connection occurs before any redirections specified by the first command (see REDIRECTION below). If
|& is used, the standard error of the first command, in addition to its standard output, is connected to the standard input of the second command through the pipe. This is shorthand for 2>&1 |. This implicit redirection of the
standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the first command.
.SS Lists
A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, or ||, and optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or a newline character.
Of these list operators, && and || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which have equal precedence.
A sequence of one or more newline characters may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.
.PP
If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background within a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.
Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.
AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the && and || control operators, respectively. These lists are executed with left associativity. An AND list has the following form:
.PP
command1 && command2
.PP
command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero.
.PP
An OR list has the following form:
.PP
command1 || command2
.PP
command2 is executed if and only if command1 returns a non-zero exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.
